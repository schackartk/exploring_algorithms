# Exploring Algorithms

In an attempt to gain a better understanding of common machine learning algorithms, I am exploring how and why they work.

This project is available on github.io to step back from the code and into the exploration

## What is here:

Each algorithm will contain its own directory in this repository. There, you will find a Rnotebook that can be knit to HTML.

There may also be a `helpers.R` file containing functions used throughout the Rnotebook.
